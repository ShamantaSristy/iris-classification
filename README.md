# Iris Classification Project 🌸

This project involves the exploration and initial analysis of the famous Iris flower dataset.

## Goals
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Perform basic visualization (pairplot, heatmap).
- Understand feature relationships.
- Prepare the dataset for future machine learning modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Visualizations
- Pairplots to observe class separations.
- Correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

## Future Work
- Build classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the final model.
