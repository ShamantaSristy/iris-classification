# Iris Classification Project 🌸

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — using simple classification models.

## Project Structure

- `data/` : Dataset files
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for training and analysis
- `src/` : (Reserved for future Python scripts)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


This project involves the exploration and initial analysis of the famous Iris flower dataset.

## Goals
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Perform basic visualization (pairplot, heatmap).
- Understand feature relationships.
- Prepare the dataset for future machine learning modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Visualizations
- Pairplots to observe class separations.
- Correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.
